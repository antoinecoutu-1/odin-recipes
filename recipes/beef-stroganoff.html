        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This beef stroganoff is made with beef chuck roast, 
            beef broth, white wine, mushrooms, and sour cream.
            It is the best I've ever had and well worth 
            the effort. I have been making this recipe for 
            over 20 years! Serve over rice or noodles.

                Add onions; cook and stir for 3 to 5 minutes,
                then push to the side with beef.
