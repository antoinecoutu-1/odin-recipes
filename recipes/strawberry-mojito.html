        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This strawberry mojito recipe makes a very 
            refreshing drink for a hot summer day! 
            I tasted this fruity cocktail at a popular 
            chain restaurant and decided to try it at home. 
            I have served it at several different 
            gatherings, and it has always been given 
            rave reviews.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>white sugar, for rimming</li>
            <li>2 large limes, quartered</li>
            <li>1/2 bunch mint leaves</li>
            <li>7 strawberries, quartered</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups club soda</li>
            <li>1 cup white rum</li>
            <li>8 cups ice cubes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour about 1/2 inch of sugar onto a small, 
                shallow plate. Run a lime wedge around the 
                rims of 8 cocktail glasses, then dip the 
                rims into sugar to coat; set aside. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Squeeze all of the lime wedges into a 
                sturdy glass pitcher. Toss juiced limes 
                into the pitcher along with mint, 
                strawberries, and 1 cup sugar. Crush with 
                a muddler to release strawberry juice and 
                mint oil. Stir in club soda and rum until 
                sugar has dissolved. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour into the prepared glasses over ice 
                cubes to serve. 
            </li>
        </ol>
